## Overview

The Biometric Data Sync Script is a versatile Python program designed to automate the monitoring and notification process for a scheduled task named "biometricdatasync." Leveraging the `schtasks.exe` utility, it can be integrated into various use cases beyond biometric data synchronization. The script monitors task completion status and sends email alerts to designated recipients, providing details about the last runtime.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Integration:**
  - The script's modular design allows for easy integration into diverse scenarios beyond biometric data synchronization. It can be adapted to monitor and notify for a wide range of scheduled tasks.

- **Automated Monitoring:**
  - Utilizing the `schtasks.exe` utility, the script automates the monitoring process, checking for the completion of scheduled tasks at specified intervals.

- **Notification Mechanism:**
  - Upon detecting a successfully completed task, the script sends detailed email notifications to designated recipients, enhancing operational awareness.

## Real-World Integration

### 1. **System Maintenance Tasks:**
   - Integrate the script to monitor and notify upon the completion of routine system maintenance tasks, ensuring timely awareness of system health.

### 2. **Database Backups:**
   - Adapt the script to monitor scheduled database backups. Receive notifications on backup completion, facilitating proactive data protection measures.

### 3. **Workflow Automation:**
   - Use the script to monitor automated workflows. Receive alerts when critical processes finish, allowing for immediate response or follow-up actions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `schtasks.exe` utility available in the system path
